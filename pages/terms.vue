        POLICY The following provisions set out our site’s Acceptable Use Policy
        that you must comply whilst you use our site: a.PROHIBITED USES You may
        use our site only for lawful purposes. You may not use our site: In any
        way that breaches any applicable local, national or international law or
        regulation. In any way that is unlawful or fraudulent, or has any
        unlawful or fraudulent purpose or effect. For the purpose of harming or
        attempting to harm minors in any way. To send, knowingly receive,
        upload, download, use or re-use any material which does not comply with
        our content standards (see below). To create serial accounts for
        disruptive or abusive purposes or with overlapping use cases. To
        knowingly transmit any data, send or upload any material that contains
        viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware,
        adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code designed
        to adversely affect the operation of any computer software or hardware.
        To transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or unauthorised
        advertising or promotional material or any other form of similar
        solicitation (spam). Examples of the factors that we will take into
        account when determining what conduct is regarded as spamming are: If
        you have followed a large amount of Users in a short amount of time; If
        you have followed and un-followed Users in a short time period,
        particularly by automated means (aggressive user churn); If you post
        misleading links; If a significant number of people have chosen to block
        you; A significant number of spam complaints have been filed against
        you; If you post the same content over multiple accounts or multiple
        duplicate updates on one account; If you post multiple unrelated updates
        to a trending or popular topic; If you add a large number of unrelated
        users to lists in an attempt to spam a service or link; If you have
        attempted to "sell" followers, particularly through tactics considered
        aggressive following or follower churn; or Creating or purchasing
        accounts in order to gain followers. You also agree: Not to reproduce,
        duplicate, copy or re-sell any part of our site in contravention of the

        unsolicited emails or messages; any equipment or network on which our
        site is stored; any software used in the provision of our site; or any
        equipment or network or software owned or used by any third party. You
        also agree: Not to engage in username squatting. Accounts that are
        inactive for 6 months or more may also be removed without further
        notice. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining
        what conduct is considered to be username squatting are: the number of
        accounts created; or creating accounts for the purpose of preventing
        others from using those account names; or creating accounts for the
        purpose of selling those accounts; or using feeds of third-party content
        to update and maintain accounts under the names of those third parties.
